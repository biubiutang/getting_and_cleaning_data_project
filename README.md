# getting_and_cleaning_data_project
This is the repo for getting and cleaning data project assignment of coursera.

You may follow the following steps to run run_analysis.R
1. Unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive.
2. set your working directory as "./UCI HAR Dataset",which is exactly the data set folder you download. (in that way, you can read the original data as in my code)
3. open file run_analysis.R
